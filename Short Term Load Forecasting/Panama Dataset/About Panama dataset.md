## Dataset Overview

The **Panama Power System dataset** contains detailed electricity consumption data, which is crucial for forecasting energy demand. It is designed for modeling **short-term load forecasting (STLF)**, where accurate predictions of electricity consumption over the next few hours or days are critical for grid management.

### Key Features

- **Electricity Load Data**: The dataset includes hourly electricity consumption (load) data from the Panama power system over a specified period, typically spanning several years. This data is critical for training load forecasting models.
  
- **Weather Data**: Meteorological data, including features such as temperature, is often included in the dataset. Weather conditions are known to influence electricity demand (e.g., higher demand for air conditioning during hot days).
  
- **Calendar Data**: The dataset includes time-related features such as day of the week, holidays, and public events. These features help capture seasonal, weekly, and event-based fluctuations in energy demand.

### Temporal Resolution

- The dataset provides **hourly** electricity load data, which is suitable for **short-term load forecasting** tasks. By using historical consumption data, these models can predict future energy demand with a high degree of accuracy.

## Applications

The **Panama Power System dataset** is widely used for various applications in the energy domain:

### 1. **Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF)**
   - **Goal**: Predict electricity load for the next 24 hours or next few hours based on historical data and external factors like weather and calendar events.
   - **Key Challenge**: Handling temporal dependencies and external influences to make accurate load predictions.
  
### 2. **Energy System Optimization**
   - **Goal**: Use the load forecasts to optimize grid operations, reduce energy costs, and ensure efficient distribution of electricity.

### 3. **Renewable Energy Integration**
   - **Goal**: Forecast energy load to better integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, which have variable generation patterns.
  
### 4. **Power System Reliability**
   - **Goal**: Accurate load forecasting ensures that energy supply meets demand without overloading the grid, preventing outages and ensuring reliable service.
